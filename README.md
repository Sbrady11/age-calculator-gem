### Created during the first phase of Dev Bootcamp after discovering there was no inbuilt age calculation method in Ruby. 

#### Installation
`gem install age_calc`

#### Version 0.1.0 
- Provides an age calculator method that takes a datetime as an input and returns an age as an integer.
- If the input is a future datetime, a negative integer is returned.
